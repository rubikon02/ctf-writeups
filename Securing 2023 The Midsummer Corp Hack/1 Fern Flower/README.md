# Fern Flower

Introduction to CTF, no flag required

> Oh, my dear child, the fern flower is indeed a wondrous thing. It is said to be a rare and magical plant that blooms only once a year and only for a brief moment at that. Its beauty is unparalleled, with delicate petals that shimmer and glow in the moonlight. 
>
> Legend has it that the fern flower appears on the eve of the summer solstice at the stroke of midnight. It can only be found deep in the forest, where it grows in a secret and hidden spot known only to the bravest and most skilled of seekers. Those who are lucky enough to find it and pick it up at the right moment are granted great powers and blessings and may even have their wishes come true. 
>
>But finding the fern flower is no easy feat, my love. It requires patience and perseverance. The forest is full of challenges; many have gone in search of the flower but have never returned. But for those who are pure of heart and steadfast in their quest, the fern flower is a reward beyond compare, a symbol of hope, magic, and wonder in our world.
